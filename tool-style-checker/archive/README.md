# Archive - Old Experimental Files

This folder contains the original experimental prompt files that were used during the development and testing phase.

## Files

- **`test_prompt.py`** - Original testing script for comparing different prompt styles
- **`test_lecture.md`** - Small test lecture used during early development
- **`old-prompts/`** - Three experimental prompt variations:
  - `strict.md` - Strict style checking approach
  - `friendly.md` - More conversational approach
  - `math_only.md` - Focused only on math notation

## Current Implementation

These files have been superseded by the production system:

- Main prompt: `../claude-style-checker-prompt.md`
- Automation script: `../style_checker.py`
- Test file: `../quantecon-test-lecture.md`

See the main README.md in the parent directory for current usage.

## Historical Note

These files were part of the prompt experimentation process to determine:
1. What tone works best for feedback
2. Whether focused prompts or comprehensive prompts are more effective
3. How to structure the output format
4. How to balance thoroughness with usability

The final implementation incorporates lessons learned from all three experimental prompts.
