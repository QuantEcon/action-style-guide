## Why Consolidate?

The multi-file structure was split for easier navigation, but feedback indicated that users prefer a single, comprehensive document they can:
- Search with Cmd+F / Ctrl+F
- Read linearly
- Reference without jumping between files
- Print or save as PDF

## Historical Note

These files represent the evolution from experimental prompt testing to production documentation. The consolidated version maintains all content while improving accessibility.
