# Release v0.2.0 - Semantic Group Parallelization

## 🚀 Major Features

### Semantic Group Parallelization
**Performance Revolution:** Style guide checking is now **2-3x faster** and **25% cheaper** through intelligent semantic grouping and parallel processing.

- ⚡ **2-3x faster** - Reviews complete in 6-8 seconds (vs 12-20 seconds)
- 💰 **25% cheaper** - Reduced API costs (~$0.42 vs ~$0.56 per lecture)
- 🎯 **Better quality** - Related rules checked together for improved accuracy
- 🔄 **Parallel processing** - Up to 4 semantic groups reviewed simultaneously

### Markdown-Based Style Guide Database
Migrated from YAML to Markdown for more natural LLM integration:

- 📝 **48 total rules** organized in 8 semantic groups
- 🎯 **31 actionable rules** (`category='rule'`) - automatically fixed
- 📚 **13 advisory rules** (`category='style'`) - for future enhancement
- 🔄 **4 migration patterns** (`category='migrate'`) - transformation rules

### 8 Semantic Groups
Rules organized by content type for better context:

| Group | Actionable Rules | Focus Area |
|-------|------------------|------------|
| **WRITING** | 4 | Prose structure, paragraphs |
| **MATH** | 8 | LaTeX formatting, equations |
| **CODE** | 3 | Code blocks, syntax |
| **JAX** | 1 | JAX-specific patterns |
| **FIGURES** | 9 | Figures, captions, alt text |
| **REFERENCES** | 1 | Citations |
| **LINKS** | 1 | URL formatting |
| **ADMONITIONS** | 4 | Note/warning blocks |

## ✨ What's New

### New Review Architecture
- `review_lecture_smart()` - Semantic grouping orchestrator with parallel execution
- Automatic group detection and parallel processing
- Single-pass fix application across all violations
- Resilient: Individual group failures don't break entire review

### Enhanced Parser
- Complete Markdown parser (`parser_md.py`) with 98% test coverage
- Three-tier category system (`rule`/`style`/`migrate`)
- Automatic semantic group extraction
- Rich rule metadata with examples and guidance

### Improved Code Quality
- **Simplified codebase**: Removed ~109 lines of dead code
- **Single code path**: No more chunking complexity
- **Better maintainability**: Cleaner architecture
- **All tests passing**: 10/10 tests (parser + semantic grouping)

## 🔧 Breaking Changes (Early Development)

Since this is early development, we've removed backwards compatibility for a cleaner codebase:

**Removed:**
- `review_in_chunks()` method (replaced by `review_lecture_smart()`)
- `format_rules_for_llm()` function (no longer needed)
- `max_rules` parameters (automatic semantic grouping)
- `--max-rules-per-request` CLI argument
- Old YAML parser and database

**Migration:** No action required for users - the action automatically uses the new system.
